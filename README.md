This is a reproduction of the article "Classification of Grapevine Leaf Images with Deep 
Learning Ensemble Models" found on the IEEE database, and published by the "4th International Conference on Computer Vision, Image and Deep Learningwhich" in 2023. This article uses deep learning methods and the "Grapevine Leaves Image" dataset to identify grape species based on their leaf morphology. The dataset can be found on kaggle and consists of 5 files with 100 images each making for a total of 500. Following the reproduction, I improved upon the study my implementing changes. The first of which was the addition of more epochs. The study only used 9 due to limited processing power, and I used between 15-20. Next, I added additional fully connected dense layers withe the ReLU activation function to keep the model from overfitting the data. Finally, I used the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) using the VGG19 pretrained model to create adversarial images to ensure the deep learning model learns the pattern rather than the dataset, therefore making it applicable to other datasets.
